# ransomware

Hey guys! I have created a ransomware using Python, thanks to NetworkChuck. 
## disclaimer
DO NOT run this program in your computer unless you're running it on a VM. I'm using a MacBook Air M1, so it's really hard for me to create VMs. I decided to run the anonymous.py in my root directory (I'm an idiot, I know) and all my files (including the system files were encrypted!!! When I ran the decryption program, it didn't work. When I noticed that I made an indention error in the decrypting file, it was too late. So now, you can call me crazy but I rewrited all the system files by myself. So untill this message isn't here anymore, don't try to run the anonymous.py program.
